# React

I wanted to create a React project I could clone whenever I want to start and explore a new project. Through using my own project, I know what each part is responsible for, as opposed to a generic boilerplate project where knowledge is traded in for simplification.

The application has a Node.js server backend, with a React front-end.

## Start
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmhn/react.git
cd react
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
